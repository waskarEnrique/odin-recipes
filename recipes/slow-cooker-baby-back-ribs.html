    <h2>Descripción</h2>

    <p>
      These slow cooker ribs are the best — they turn out perfect every time!
      They cook in a crockpot until tender, then are covered with barbeque sauce
      and finished in the oven for fall-apart ribs. Perfect for during the week
      as the slow cooker does most of the work!

    <h2>Ingredientes</h2>

      <li>3 pounds baby back ribs, trimmed</li>
